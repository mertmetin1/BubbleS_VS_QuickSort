# BubbleS_VS_QuickSort
Performance and Complexity Analysis of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort Algorithms

Introduction:
Sorting algorithms are methods used to arrange the elements in an array in a specific order. In this report, we will compare the performance and complexities of the Bubble Sort and Quick Sort algorithms. Additionally, we will analyze their efficiency to examine how these algorithms perform with different array sizes.
